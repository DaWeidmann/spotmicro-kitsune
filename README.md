# Spot Micro | Kitsune

## Introduction

A Raspberry Pi Zero powered, 3D printable quadruped robot - inspired by @KDY0523's [SpotMicro](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283) and the work of the [SpotMicroAI](https://gitlab.com/public-open-source/spotmicroai) community, especially Michael Kubina's [SpotMicroESP32](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32) project.

As a baseline, I will use the cited previous work, but I aim to improve on many aspects, regarding both hardware and software.

All the 3D printable parts will be managed in a separate repository that will be included as a git-submodule later.

## Project Name

The project's name "kitsune" is the Japanese word for "fox", which I choose for two reasons: Firstly, for printing the robot I had some orange and white filament lying around, so that the color scheme of my robot resembled a fox closely. Secondly, I am interested in the Japanese language and color and also fond of the animal and the role it has in [Japanese folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsune).
